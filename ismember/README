ismember - check if a swedish personal number is a paying member

You need a webserver and a database server.

Copy example-config.php to local-config.php and edit the values inside.

The tablename must match the database table for the administrators,
default is adminusers.

Create the database table, see default configuration in db/structure.sql.

Add administrators.
  INSERT INTO adminusers (username, password) VALUES ('admin', sha1('nimda'));

Config your webserver to serve ismember.php as default page at some URL.
